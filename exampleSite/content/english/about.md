My broad arena of study is in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.  
I am a skilled software engineer with strong expertise in cloud-native development, microservice-based architecture, and Kubernetes. I have experience in driving the migration of services to cloud infrastructure and enhancing system resilience. I have a strong knowledge of Golang, Kubernetes, Python, and software engineering principles.  
I was previously working as a software engineer for Veritas Technologies.  
Working for a product that enables Data Protection, I've come to strongly value the need for privacy and security in general. Getting involved into traiging and solving defects, I've come face-to-face with the issues of secure communication, security vulnerabilities that riddle the domain. To add to it, adherence to privacy requirements makes the problem even more interesting to solve.  

For a short while, I'd dabbled into the world of Databases as well, and had worked for a while modelling semi-structured/unstructured data.

In my free time, I try to capture my understanding of the world of AI [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zVg4f_-iXtzJQdExT35TnOWX5CDr9BXwB_Bpq2ChYVI/edit?usp=sharing).  

I am also into a wee bit of vocal music and enjoy literary fiction.  
I write, at times, for happiness!  
If I show my appreciation for something, I'd be likely to call it 'Art'.
