My broad arena of study is in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.
However, in my short life, I've forayed into the fields of Computational Intelligence especially Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and a bit of Human Computer Interation, specifically, User Experience Research. I'm interested in studying privacy protecting and accesibility-enhancing software design, in general, too.  
I'm currently working as a software engineer for Veritas Technologies.  
Working for a product that enables Data Protection, I've come to strongly value the need for privacy and security in general. Getting involved into traiging and solving defects, I've come face-to-face with the issues of secure communication, security vulnerabilities that riddle the domain. To add to it, adherence to privacy requirements makes the problem even more interesting to solve.  

For a short while, I'd dabbled into the world of Databases as well, and had worked for a while modelling semi-structured/unstructured data.

In my free time, I try to capture my understanding of the world of AI [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zVg4f_-iXtzJQdExT35TnOWX5CDr9BXwB_Bpq2ChYVI/edit?usp=sharing).  

I am also into a wee bit of vocal music and enjoy literary fiction.  
I write, at times, for happiness!  
If I show my appreciation for something, I'd be likely to call it 'Art'.
