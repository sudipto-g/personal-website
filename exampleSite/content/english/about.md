My broad arena of study is in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.
However, in my short life, I've forayed into the fields of Computational Intelligence especially Computer Vision, Statistical Machine Learning, Data Mining and a bit of Soft Computing.

I'm also interested in out-of-the-distribution generalisation and explainability in Deep Learning.

For a short while, I've dabbled into the world of Databases as well, and had worked for a while modelling semi-structured/unstructured data.

In my free time, I try to capture my understanding of the world of AI [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zVg4f_-iXtzJQdExT35TnOWX5CDr9BXwB_Bpq2ChYVI/edit?usp=sharing).
I am also into a wee bit of vocal music and enjoy literary fiction. 
I also write, at times, for happiness! If I show my appreciation for something, I'd be likely to call it 'Art'.
