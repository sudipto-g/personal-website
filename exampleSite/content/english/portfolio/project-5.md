#### Project Details
B.Tech thesis under Prof. Dr. Asit Kumar Das.
Compared structural, neighborhood-based, Graph Attention & GNN based node as well as edge representation methods v/s Heuristic
based featurization for edges.  
Experimented using node representations with ensemble ML models and empirically tried neural network architectures for predicting links on 4 different social network datasets.  
Finally, proposed a combination of learned representations and heuristics. Demonstrated improvements in F1 score across most datasets and predictive modelling techniques using this new feature set.
