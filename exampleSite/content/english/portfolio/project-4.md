#### Project Requirements

NetBackup (NBU) is a flagship offering of the company for data protection. Despite having a rich customer base, various problems riddle the product management, reporting and day-to-day usage.  
In this work, NBU’s User Experience landscape is studied, and examined, why in particular, customers find it “Complex”.  
To that end, the “experience” of using NBU is broken down into various phases and analyzed quantitatively. We also suggest areas in which investment should be made to address user demands.  
The work, undertaken by Radhika Wakankar and myself, has been published as a Technical Paper in Veritas Illuminate 2023.
